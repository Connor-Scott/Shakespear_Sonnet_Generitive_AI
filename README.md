##Shakespear Sonnet Generator 

Introduction
This is a generative AI model trained on all of Shakespeare’s sonnets. Sonnets provided ideal training material for the model because of their uniform structure. The model 

Features
Classical Sonnet Generation: Produces sonnets with adherence to traditional structures and themes.
Stylistic Diversity: Trained on a diverse corpus of sonnets to capture a wide range of poetic styles.
Saved Model: File containing the trained model is included, both as a .keras file and the legacy .h5 file. 

LSTM Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of two LSTM layers, and a dense output layer to predict the next character in a sequence. The RNN type of architecture captures syntax, structure, and words because of its memory component. 

Dataset
The model was trained on "Shakespeare's Sonnets” collected from Project Gutenberg. Shakespeare Sonnets were chosen because of their uniform text structure, unique stye, and availability.
